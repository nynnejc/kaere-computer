{"pageProps":{"content":"\nKære Computer,\n\\\n\\\nI want add a guestbook on [my website](https://nynnechristoffersen.com/)!\n\\\n\\\n![butterfly divider]( /asciidividers/butterfly-divider.gif)\n\\\n\\\nLike a [lot of millennials](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/coming-of-age-at-the-dawn-of-the-social-internet), I am deeply nostalgic about the internet of yesteryear and love aesthetics that reminds me of discovering the web. I want to tap into the same curiosity and excitement I had about technology, when I was using the enormous Windows 10 machine in the living room to dial up the internet or play [Kings Quest VII](https://youtu.be/7rfVE2JvLqA?feature=shared) for hours on end.\n\\\n\\\nAnd so I think my [otherwise beautiful website](https://nynnechristoffersen.com/) needs a guestbook, in order to feel like one of the websites I created as a bored tween. I love the one computational designer and textile artist [Vera van de Seyp](Vera van de Seyp) has created as a beautiful letter type machine. I started an are.na [guestbook mood board](https://www.are.na/nynne-christoffersen/virtual-guestbook) to try and research both the aesthetics and functionality I'm going for.  \n\\\n\\\nDid you roam free on the aol internet of guest books and visitor-counters? Can you remember if there were any you actually used, or think of contemporary examples of guest books you've seen in the wild that you liked? Please let me know!\n\\\n\\\n![plz sign my guestbook]( /posts/guestbook1.gif)\n\\\n\\\nThanks for reading.\n\\\n\\\n♡ Nynne\n\\\n\\\n![plz sign my guestbook]( /posts/guestbook2.gif)\n![plz sign my guestbook]( /posts/guestbook3.gif)\n![plz sign my guestbook]( /posts/guestbook.gif)\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Guestbook","date":"Sunday, Aug 25, 2024"}},"__N_SSG":true}

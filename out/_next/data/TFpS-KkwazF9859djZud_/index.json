I think this is going to be a not-so-newsworthy place where I delve into things that aren't necessarily in the news-cycle just now. There will be no listicles! No hot takes on the latest and greatest!\n\\\n\\\nThis will be a place where I collect my thoughts on topics that inspire me to be technical, to learn, teach and build things. To be critical of tech ecosystems, tools and paradigms. Every newsletter will be a selection of things I find meaningful and gives me energy at present. A deep-dive into an area that always fascinated me or unpacking a theme that I find particularly exciting.\n\\\n\\\nKære Computer is Danish for _Dear Computer_. I am typing this letter on/to my device. Writing code is a kind of conversation with a machine. Like talking to someone who has no sense of humor at all. Computers are a tough audience to write for. Often I'll mumble under my breath, while trying to make something work: Dear Computer, please work! \n\\\n\\\nThis newsletter is for anyone interested in technology and I aim for making it beginner-friendly for readers not yet well-versed in programming. \n\\\n\\\n![flickering computer screens gif](/posts/1-1.gif)\n\\\n\\\nwhoami? I'm a fullstack programmer, currently working mostly with React and Typescript. I wasn't always, though. I was late to discover my interest in computers, and I'll tell you the story about how it happened in one of the next letters :)\n\\\n\\\nThanks for reading along / subscribing.\n\\\n\\\n♡Nynne\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Intro"}},{"slug":"2.html","content":"\nI've been thinking a lot about [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (Hyper Text Markup Language) lately. It is a markup language for structuring the content of websites. Its syntax is in fact so simple that a lot of folks on the internet will get [_very_ upset](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+isnt+a+programming+language+meme&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiGos6NpufvAhW0UOUKHfy9C54Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=html+isnt+a+programming+language+meme&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1DU2ANY_N4DYIfjA2gAcAB4AIABOYgB_gGSAQE1mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=XxxrYMb2K7ShlQf8-67wCQ&bih=962&biw=1654&hl=en) if you call it a programming language. I don't care. I need to collect zero nerd point over this. This is a sincere fan letter to HTML.\n\\\n\\\n![90's internet-dialup graphics](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/15080107/original_0b49e545ae2af8addfff31febf140282.png?1644343727?bc=0)\n\\\n\\\nAre you [older or younger](https://howoldistheinter.net/) than the internet? I grew up with it, and I think that is why the early stages of www feels so nostalgic to me. Pure HTML is how the internet looked when I first encountered it, and at a time when it was simpler in a lot of ways and felt like a more [pure place](http://www.wonder-tonic.com/geocitiesizer/index.php) to hang out than it does today. A perfect example is the very first website to ever be made. Did you know it is preserved for your enjoyment? [Here it is in all its glory](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). This is what HTML gives us: content (headline, paragraphs, links, images, tables) with no styling whatsoever to make it pretty. Functional brutalist and beautiful!\n\\\n\\\nModern web development is constant flux. As a web developer, I need to keep up with a staggering amount of changes to the languages and frameworks I use for work. I also need to learn a couple of new ones every few years or so, in order to keep my skills current. In a world that is always changing, HTML is forever! I mean, isn't it incredible that the first website ever created is written in such a simple and powerful markup language that it perfectly renderes in every browser known to man today — some 30+ years ago.\n\\\n\\\n![]()\n### Beginner-friendly\n\n\\\n\\\nHTML is what you use to organize the content of a website with tags, such as headlines, paragraphs, links, images and lists. It is as versatile and box-shaped as LEGO bricks, simple and relatively beginner-friendly to learn. If you're excited about learning how to build websites, [this is the place to start](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-html-handbook/) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkzbI1Tv_rQ). There is a finite number of tags you need to learn in order to create your very first website and see it render in the browser.\n\\\n\\\n![cartoon with three cats working on connected desktop computers](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/1965212/original_15a28e3e37b325c3f1f1ba4bb5ff7fbd.gif?1522276401?bc=1)\n\\\n\\\n![]()\n### Accesible\n\\\n\\\nWhen building for the web, you need to keep inclusion and accessibility in mind. Just like a responsible architect should include ramps and escalators so that the finished building can be used by people with disabilities, [web accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility) is about making sure web projects can be used by people with disabilities such as vision impairment, \nblind, deaf or people who can't use a computer mouse. HTML, particularly [semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML) is structured in a way that automatically makes it work for screen readers and enables keyboard navigation. \n\\\n\\\nA lot of the challenges to make websites accessible, is that we keep adding more and more complexity. A lot of it is nice and makes your experience on the internet more interactive and visually immersive. Some of it is pure evil and centered around tracking your every move and selling you toothpaste. The simplest [motherfucking website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) made with HTML will be the most accessible any day. Web accessibility is a big and really exciting topic in and of itself. I might dedicate a whole newsletter to the necessity, purpose and [poetry](https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/) of it.\n\\\n\\\n![Mondrian painting made with pure html scroll-panes](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/15075618/original_25cef302240e23188109a28cab336596.png?1644332427?bc=0) \n\\\n\\\n![]()\n### Beautiful!\n\\\n\\\nWhat initially caught my interest in HTML was encountering a bunch of artists and designers that challenged me to think of it as an _aesthetic_. It all started When Johanne made me aware of the prolific artist, interaction designer and Princeton lecturer [Laurel Schwulst](https://laurelschwulst.com/). Listening to the interviews with artists and designer in her podcast, [HTML Energy](http://html.energy/podcast.html), reminds me how much fun it is to be able to draw something that fills the screen in my browser. It makes me question why technology have to be so hard. I am also inspired by designer [Mindy Seu](https://mindyseu.com/), artist [Agnes Cameron](https://agnescameron.info/), among many others. \n\\\n\\\nI started to think that pure HTML [can be beautiful](https://htmlonly.tumblr.com/). Shoutout to Pernille who found [this pretty HTML page](http://faergejournalen.dk/) in the wild. \n\\\n\\\nThanks for reading.\n\\\n\\\n♡ Nynne\n\\\n\\\n![gif of spinning globe](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/7789788/original_78801dc8e52e155f6ed530f2c7da32fb.gif?1593154700?bc=0)\n\\\n\\\n![animated e-mail logo](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/7789668/original_0e4553b7b3397cc3cb8b01ee5b1e1dc4.gif?1593154656?bc=0)","frontmatter":{"title":"HTML"}},{"slug":"3.html","content":"\nKære Computer,\n\\\n\\\nOoof it has been a minute since I started ye olde newsletter more than two years ago, never to be heard from again.\nWhat did I do in the meantime? Well not much, except __**TWO ENTIRE HUMANS**__. Talk about a task I'm glad I underestimated beforehand.\nIn my extremely limited downtime, I enjoyed digging myself deeper into the rabbit hole of how to optimize the technical aspect of this blog.\nI spent entirely too much time over-engineering a custom [static page generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) for these Markdown posts,\nbuilding a custom continuous delivery pipeline with [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) that publishes the changes from every git commit to a cloud server instantaneously.\n\\\n\\\n![Question mark](/posts/huh.png)\n\\\n\\\n*Then* I finally got cracking on implementing the immaculately cute design for the blog that\n[AK](https://www.instagram.com/annekatrineraahede/) made me, also two whole years ago.\nPlease please if you're reading this in the newsletter format, go to the [web](https://nynnechristoffersen.com/) and look at it there on **desktop**, to get the full experience.\n\\\n\\\n![perfect when I'm dead](/posts/perfect.png)\n\\\n\\\nOne of the reasons I have postponed writing for this long, has perhaps also been some kind of trepidation, not wanting to come out with anything less than **perfect**.\nA feeling that only grew as time moved on. With this meandering nothing-burger post, I hope to get over that, or at least shushhh the voice enough to get to writing.\nNot necessarily with any kind of promise of frequency. But with the kind of open, curious and excited space in my mind I can only find if I manage to suspend judgment and\ntoss out all \"plans for greatness\".

Like: \"My favourite class is the one where the docent learned us (...)\". Because in the German, its sort of the same word, just used differently to emphasize context. I really like this conceptual mixup! I have been thinking a lot about what it means to learn how to be a programmer recently. How teaching and learning is two sides of the same practise, for me. I get to think it over again while I'm preparing an intro class on programming for my new job as lecturer at the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology ([KEA](https://kea.dk/en/)), while simultaneously learning a new programming language again myself - Java.\n\\\n\\\n![ascii divider]( /asciidividers/asciidividers-02.png)\n\\\n\\\nProgramming is a set of instructions that specifies to a machine how to do something. The computer must be told in *escrutiating detail* how to do anything. Machines are dumb as rocks and don't understand hints or humor. They can't imagine what you mean unless you express it exactly right. When you knit a sweater, you are the computer and the recipe is the program you run. \n\\\n\\\n![Error!]( /posts/error.jpg)\n\\\n\\\nComputers actually can't do much. Here's a list of the instructions that are acceptable:\n\n- **Input**\n   Get data from a keayboard, file, sensor or other device.\n- **Output**\n   Display data on a screen or send it to a file or other device.\n- **Math**\n   Perform basic mathematical operations.\n- **Secision**\n   Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.\n- **Repetition**\n   Perform an action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\n\\\n\\\nEvery program you've ever used, regardless of how complex or sophisticated it appears, is made up of these small computational building blocks. **Programming** really is the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks, until they are small and simple enough to be performed with the electronic circuits provided by the hardware. Everything must be translated to biip booop fluent machine.\n\\\n\\\n![Grace Hopper]( /posts/gracehopper.png)\n\\\n\\\nGrace Hopper invented the [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler), which in a sense is the translator that we have in all modern (high-level) programming languages that turns human natural language instructions (computer code) into something the machine understands. She also coined the term **debugging**, at a time when a computer took up the space of an entire building, and running a program could be interrupted by a moth getting stuck in a relay! \n\\\n\\\n![Why isn't my code working yin and yang]( /posts/whymycode.webp)\n\\\n\\\nToday a bug is what we call all and any *programming errors*, and debugging is the process of of tracking down the errors and *fixing* them. When you try to build something out of lines of code, you can be sure to get **plenty** of errors Debugging is one of the most valuable skills you can hone as a programmer. It can be incredibly frustrating to find the error and spend lots of time on it, especially if it turns out to be something dumb like a typo, unsaved file somewhere or a forgotten `npm i`. Not knowing how to make the thing work, can trigger the worst and most deeply held belief that I'm a dumb-dumb.\n\\\n\\\n![Man wearing INSECURITY t-shirt]( /posts/insecurity.webp)\n\\\n\\\nI always struggled with this. I don't feel like a natural talent. I didn't assemble my own computer when I was a kid, or build my own game in highschool -for fun-. I'm a slow learner and nothing has ever been easy breezy about building this technical career for myself. The only thing I have going for me is stubbornness, and sometimes even that fails me too. \n\\\n\\\n![Did I hear negative self talk? Motivational frog is not having it]( /posts/urgreat.webp)\n\\\n\\\nIts one of the reasons why I love to teach intro to programming for beginners. I always found it easier to be kind, patient and encouraging of making mistakes when other people are making them. Something clicks whenever I am able to help/motivate/cheer/give the right tools to another person who is struggling. I *stil* struggle. But I found some comfort in leaning into good habits when I get stuck for too long and the dark clouds of self-doubt begin to gather above my head. Sometimes one of the best things to do, if you can, is take a break! \n\\\n\\\n![ascii divider]( /asciidividers/asciidividers-03.png)\n\\\n\\\nAnother incredibly helpful way out of the soup-of-despair is calling a friend. I saw Alma the other day to knit and drink coffee. But also ask her, with my laptop perched between us on the wobbly cafe table, how to simply run something in my terminal, after I had fallen into the deepest, darkest, toxic youtube pit of 10x-engineer-dude-splaining madness. The issue I've had the most with learning anything technical, has been about being patient and kind to myself. Most things that are worth getting good at, take time! Via Rusty Foster's brilliant newsletter, I learned that in 1991, songwriter Ron Miller wrote a set of affirmations for the practice of music, which Glitch user @thricedotted made into [a web app that can be adapted to any art](https://practice-guide.glitch.me/): \"It is only code and I am a beautiful person.\"\n\\\n\\\nThanks for reading.\n\\\n\\\n♡ Nynne\n\\\n\\\n![Butterfly gif](/posts/sommerfugl.gif)\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"It is only code"}},{"slug":"5.html","content":"\nKære Computer,\n\\\n\\\nI want add a guestbook on [my website](https://nynnechristoffersen.com/)!\n\\\n\\\n![butterfly divider]( /asciidividers/butterfly-divider.gif)\n\\\n\\\nLike a [lot of millennials](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/coming-of-age-at-the-dawn-of-the-social-internet), I am deeply nostalgic about the internet of yesteryear and love aesthetics that reminds me of discovering the web. I want to tap into the same curiosity and excitement I had about technology, when I was using the enormous Windows 10 machine in the living room to dial up the internet or play [Kings Quest VII](https://youtu.be/7rfVE2JvLqA?feature=shared) for hours on end.\n\\\n\\\nAnd so I think my [otherwise beautiful website](https://nynnechristoffersen.com/) needs a guestbook, in order to feel like one of the websites I created as a bored tween.

I feel like I have done nothing but be stuck in survival mode all winter. But that&#x27;s not quite true. These are some of the things I made / did / thought about / pushed to Github recently:

<br/>
<!-- -->I talked about Elon Musk (again?) with AK and Maia in <a href="https://cybernauterne.dk/podcast/cybernormer-30-elon-donald/">Cybernormer podcast</a> (in Danish), and at least we had fun rounding up the absurdities and compiling an <em>insane</em> amount of footnotes on all the evil shit.

<!-- -->I switched jobs last year, and have been a lecturer at the Computer Science degree at <a href="https://kea.dk/en/">KEA - Copenhagen School of Design and Technology</a> ever since. It has mainly been difficult because I have two two-year-olds. I love teaching, and feel like it makes me grow skills that are both &#x27;soft&#x27; and &#x27;hard&#x27;, i.e. I am constantly having to become both a better person and programmer, because I teach.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<!-- -->Until recently my personal website was over-engineered to the Nth degree. I had somehow cornered myself into creating a site using Next, Express, React and deploying to AWS via Github Actions. The project built static HTML pages from Markdown files, that were then sent on every commit to an s3 bucket in a kind of scrappy and much too complicated <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/pipeline">CD pipeline</a>. I had been dead set on hosting this thing on AWS, because I wanted to improve my skills there and so it didn&#x27;t matter to me that the whole thing was overkill. The point of it all was to learn!

<!-- -->But early this year, I felt the need for a change and started questioning if the site really needed to exist inside this huge, heavy ecosystem. I talked to <a href="https://benna100.github.io/portfolio/">Benjamin</a> about it and he repeated advice back to me that I had completely forgotten I gave to him years ago: do the simplest thing. Don&#x27;t overdo it on the tech stack. If it can be solved with a static site, don&#x27;t add any more bells and whistles just because you want it to impress technically. So I separated out all the parts of the project that were just the personal site pages and built a <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfucking website</a> for myself <a href="https://nynnechristoffersen.com/">with not much in it, except pretty colors, text and links</a>. A site that gets an impressive 99 point on Googles <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed Insights</a> (it&#x27;s a tool for looking up a how fast a site is to load). It looks like I only lost 1 point because the SEO of the site is not great. Dear reader, I care not about SEO.

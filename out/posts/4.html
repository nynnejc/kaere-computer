<!-- -->A common misnomer I remember hearing lots, way back when I worked at a university in Germany, is the use of the noun <em>learning</em> instead of <em>teaching</em> in a sentence. Like: &quot;My favourite class is the one where the docent learned us (...)&quot;. Because in the German, its sort of the same word, just used differently to emphasize context. I really like this conceptual mixup! I have been thinking a lot about what it means to learn how to be a programmer recently. How teaching and learning is two sides of the same practise, for me. I get to think it over again while I&#x27;m preparing an intro class on programming for my new job as lecturer at the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kea.dk/en/">KEA</a>), while simultaneously learning a new programming language again myself - Java.

<!-- -->Programming is a set of instructions that specifies to a machine how to do something. The computer must be told in <em>escrutiating detail</em> how to do anything. Machines are dumb as rocks and don&#x27;t understand hints or humor. They can&#x27;t imagine what you mean unless you express it exactly right. When you knit a sweater, you are the computer and the recipe is the program you run.

<!-- -->Computers actually can&#x27;t do much. Here&#x27;s a list of the instructions that are acceptable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input</strong>
Get data from a keayboard, file, sensor or other device.</li>
<li><strong>Output</strong>
Display data on a screen or send it to a file or other device.</li>
<li><strong>Math</strong>
Perform basic mathematical operations.</li>
<li><strong>Secision</strong>
Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.</li>
<li><strong>Repetition</strong>
Perform an action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

<!-- -->Every program you&#x27;ve ever used, regardless of how complex or sophisticated it appears, is made up of these small computational building blocks. <strong>Programming</strong> really is the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks, until they are small and simple enough to be performed with the electronic circuits provided by the hardware. Everything must be translated to biip booop fluent machine.

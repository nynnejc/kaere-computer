<!-- -->A few years ago, I made a book club session with the artist Natalia Tikhonova as part of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/calculationart/">the Calculation Art project</a> online residency program, where we read the book ‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://archive.org/details/illich-conviviality">Tools for conviviality</a>’ by Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich. In the book from (1973), Illich writes that the nature of modern ‘tools’, from machines to schools, has the effect of making people dependent and undermine their own natural abilities. He suggest that we instead create what he called “convivial tools”. These are tools that encourage people to think for themselves and be more socially engaged.

<em>&quot;Convivial tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or her vision.&quot;</em>

In a culture obsessed with the negative and dystopian sci-fi views on technology, it stands out because it proposes positive solutions to tech-problems, and encourages to look constructively at the mess we&#x27;ve made of our modern world.

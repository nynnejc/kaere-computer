Kære Computer,
\
\
The sun is out, finally. I feel like I survived the toughest winter of my life (again?) and its the [loveliest morning in a hundred years and I'm alive](https://youtu.be/4uMjlRkFnic). Meanwhile the world is on fire and everything seems to become rapidly shittier, more expensive, shrinkflate and collide into a WWIII / super depression. I talked about Elon Musk (again?) with AK and Maia in [Cybernormer podcast](https://cybernauterne.dk/podcast/cybernormer-30-elon-donald/) (in Danish), and at least we had fun rounding up the absurdities and compiling an _insane_ amount of footnotes on all the evil shit.

I switched jobs in August last year, and have been a lecturer at the Computer Science degree at [KEA - Copenhagen School of Design and Technology](https://kea.dk/en/) ever since. I love teaching, and feel like it makes me grow skills that are both 'soft' and 'hard', i.e. I am constantly having to become both a better person and programmer because I teach.

Kære Computer,

I want add a guestbook on [my website](https://nynnechristoffersen.com/)!

Like a [lot of millennials](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/coming-of-age-at-the-dawn-of-the-social-internet), I am deeply nostalgic about the internet of yesteryear and love aesthetics that reminds me of discovering the web. I want to tap into the same curiosity and excitement I had about technology, when I was using the enormous Windows 10 machine in the living room to dial up the internet or play [Kings Quest VII](https://youtu.be/7rfVE2JvLqA?feature=shared) for hours on end.
\
\
And so I think my [otherwise beautiful website](https://nynnechristoffersen.com/) needs a guestbook, in order to feel like one of the websites I created as a bored tween. I love the one computational designer and textile artist [Vera van de Seyp](Vera van de Seyp) has created as a beautiful letter type machine. I started an are.na [guestbook mood board](https://www.are.na/nynne-christoffersen/virtual-guestbook) to try and research both the aesthetics and functionality I'm going for.

Did you roam free on the aol internet of guest books and visitor-counters? Can you remember if there were any you actually used, or think of contemporary examples of guest books you've seen in the wild that you liked? Please let me know!
